OVAL Synthetic Schema
=============

The OVAL schema employed by Joval is a combination of the official OVAL community language, with some unofficial extensions merged in.

It is not possible to use Joval's supported scap-extensions mechanism for the unofficial additions integrated here, because they are not confined to isolated XML namespaces.
