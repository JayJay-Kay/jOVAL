Release Streams
===============

The OVAL Community maintains 4 different OVAL Language release streams:

* `Development`_: all adopted Proposals awaiting release into Stable
* `Stable`_: all adopted Proposals qualified for release into Stable as the most recent February 1st or August 1st
* `Official`_: a Stable Release that the OVAL Board selects as the Official release at least once a year
* `Extensions`_: Proposals that were not adopted, but are made available as Unofficial Extensions

For more details on the release process, see :ref:`release-process`.

Development
------------

Once a Proposal is Adopted by the Community, it is immediately published into the Development release stream where
it will stay until it has sufficient :ref:`Qualifying Implmentations <release-process>` and is released into `Stable`_.

Stable
------

On February 1st and August 1st of each year, all Proposals that have been Adopted by the Community and have a sufficient 
:ref:`Qualifying Implmentations <release-process>` are released into `Stable`_.

Official
--------

The Official release stream is a Stable release selected by the OVAL Board at least once per year to be the Official release.

Extensions
----------

The Extensions release stream includes Proposals that were not Adopted, but have been made available as unofficial extensions
to the OVAL language at the request of a Community member. Extensions enable Community members to publicly document schemas 
that are not adopted by the Community.
