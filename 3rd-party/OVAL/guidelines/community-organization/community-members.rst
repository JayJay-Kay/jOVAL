Joining the OVAL Community is free and all you need to do is join one of our :ref:`oval-mailing-lists` and make a contribution, whether that be asking questions, answering questions, making language proposals or contributions of other kinds. Proposals and issues can best be raised through Github, which requires an account. If you don't have one, set one up `here <https://github.com/join>`_ and start contributing!
