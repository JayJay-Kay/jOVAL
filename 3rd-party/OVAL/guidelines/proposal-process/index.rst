Proposal Process
================

The Proposal Process is the way we collaborate to improve OVAL, including:

- Fixing a defect in the OVAL schemas or documentation
- Adding new features, tests, or platforms
- Updating these Guidelines (e.g. the Developer Guides, Content Repository Listings, etc.)
- Updating this Proposal Process itself! 

In fact, the only things that are NOT updated via the Proposal Process are:

- The :ref:`oval-leadership-board`, :ref:`area-supervisors` and :ref:`oval-sponsor` (follow links to learn more)
- The OVAL Mission, Use Cases and :ref:`oval-design-principles` (these are maintained by the :ref:`oval-leadership-board`)


Process Overview
----------------

Here is a quick rundown of the process. Please click through the links to read more about each phase.

#. :ref:`create-an-issue`: anyone may create an Issue describing a problem or suggesting an enhancement
#. :ref:`initial-proposal`: anyone may submit a Proposal for resolving the Issue so the community can review and provide feedback
#. :ref:`alternate-proposals`: community members may submit Alternate Proposals for resolving the Issue
#. :ref:`objections`: community members may also Object to a Proposal if they think it conflicts with an OVAL Design Principle
#. :ref:`consensus-building`: the relevant Area Supervisor decides when there is Rough Consensus for adopting a Proposal
#. :ref:`release-process`: the adopted Proposal is released into Development and considered for release into Stable and Official
